# Accounts Receivable Trend & Segmentation Analysis

**Tools:** Python | Jupyter Notebook | Machine Learning (KMeans, Linear Regression)

This project explores customer payment behavior and portfolio optimization by analyzing Accounts Receivable (AR) and profitability data. The goal is to provide actionable insights for management, highlighting high-value customers and identifying potential collection risks.

## Features

- **Data Evaluation:** Examined AR and profitability datasets to uncover patterns in customer payment behavior.  
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed raw data for machine learning analysis.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applied KMeans clustering to group customers by value and payment behavior.  
- **Trend Modeling:** Used linear regression to model payment trends and detect signals of potential collection risks.

## Objectives

- **Identify high-value customers** who contribute the most to the organization.  
- **Highlight customers at risk** who may require strategic reconsideration or closer monitoring.  
- **Demonstrate machine learning** applications for enhancing financial analytics.
